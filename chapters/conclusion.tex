In this paper we have looked at the AlphaGo family of algorithms in the hopes of shedding some light on how the internals work. We have taken the perspective of looking at 2 player zero sum games and how they have historically been solved. We then showed how AlpahGo fits into this history. We discussed a bit about what goes into actually building out your own version of the program. Using our own version we looked at a number of experiments that helped us understand how the different parameters of the algorithm affect overall performance. The AlphaZero algorithm is quite elegant but it requires a tremendous amount of tuning. This tuning cost is prohibitively costly in larger domains if you are on a limited budget. That being said the algorithm has proven to be very successful in the game of Go and in other domain. In concluding this paper I would like to highlight a few advances since AlphaZero that are worth noting. I hope that these will givc the reader a good idea of where to go next if they are interested in pursuing this topic further.
