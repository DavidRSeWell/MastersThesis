    In this paper I will explain the AlphaGo family of algorithms starting from first principles and requiring little previous knowledge from the reader. The focus will be upon AlphaGo Zero [1] but I hope to explain the core principles that allowed this algorithm to be so successful. AlphaGo Zero in short combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Deep learning and self-play. We will break down each of these pieces and look at examples to clarify understanding. I implemented a simplified version of the algorithm on TicTacToe and Connect4 and the code is available online as well as a dashboard that allows you to play against a trained agent.
